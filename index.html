            <h1>JavaScript Basics</h1>
            <br>
            <p>JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now embedded in some servers, usually via Node.js. They are also embedded in a variety of applications created with frameworks such as Electron and Cordova.</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p><a href="#">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These names are called
                      identifiers. <span>var x</span></p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p><a href="#">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee pured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span>var x = 10;</span></p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p><a href="#">Data Types</a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span>true</span> or <span>false;</span> null
                      - <span>null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span>42</span> or <span>3.14159;</span> String - <span>"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array - <span>[1,'Coding',2,'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span>{first_name:'Jane',last_name:'Doe'}</span></p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p><a href="#">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code
                      to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <span>if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our block; <span>else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span>else</span>            we execute this block of code;</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p><a href="#">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action a certain number of times. Imagine you run a mile, well you run around the track
                      four times and then you stop. That's a loop.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p><a href="#">Function</a> Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open
                      up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over
                      again.</p>
